    "The United States was born out of the colonies' desire to free itself from the tyranny of a government who held complete control over their commerce and rights. This wariness of a centralized governmental structure has created a special form of a federal presidential republic which influences may aspects of how the government runs today, such as the separation of powers as labeled within the United States Constitution. The states can be considered, to an extent, nations within a nation. A study published in 2023 by smartasset<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"><a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) displays one aspect of this relationship - the depth to which states receive their funding from the federal government. But after decades of peace and prosperity as a singular united nation on the world stage - how many maintain this level of self-sufficiency in disasters, conditions outside their regular capacities?\n",

This could be through yearly reports from each state about the amount spent in disaster reliefs. These documents are typically stored in a spreadsheet format, where each column could represent the variables mentioned above and rows could represent each state. One possible way it could be organized is by state order, most money spent to least, or vice versa.\n",
