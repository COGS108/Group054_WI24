    "The United States was born out of the colonies' desire to free from the tyranny of a government holding complete control over their commerce and rights. This wariness of a centralized governmental structure influences many aspects of how the government runs today, such as the separation of powers as labeled within the United States Constitution. The states can be considered, to an extent, nations within a nation. A study published in 2023 by smartasset<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) displays one aspect of this relationship - the depth to which states receive their funding from the federal government. But after decades of peace and prosperity as a singular united nation on the world stage - how many maintain this level of self-sufficiency in disasters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source we looked at was a data science project done by Money Geek that looked at which states were most reliant on federal aid. This project is relevant to ours because federal aid reduces the burden on a states budget and how much they can allocate towards disaster relief <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). To compute this, the team at Money Geek did not just look at total federal aid, but looked at federal funding as a percentage of state revenue and return on tax dollars which was a statistic showing how much the state got back for every dollar that they gave the government. What we learned from the metrics used (such as aid as a percentage of state revenue and return on tax dollars) is that often a data set will require a lot of cleaning and development of our own metrics before we can get the answer to our question. Our question being the relation between GDP and a state's amount spent on disaster relief. From the Money Geek project, we also saw how others incorporate graphs into their findings. Money geek did a very good job about making the main findings visible in the titles of their graphs and throughout their paragraphs. For example, one of the main findings from the data set was that states that get the most in federal aid are often republican states. Then, they created a illustrative bar chart to display this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, another project we found relevant from economy.com looking at how natural disasters affect national GDP, which we also found relevant to our project as it relates to natural disasters and uses GDP as a metric. However, our project takes a different angle by using GDP as a measure of a states self sufficiency and seeing how that correlates to how much disaster relief aid that state gets. Some relevant take-aways from the source were that natural disasters only have a minor impact on national GDP but can be very impactful for local GDP. For example, from economy.com calculations, real GDP growth for New Orleans fell 20% at an annual rate in the third quarter of 2005 after Katrina <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",

    "- States whose primary revenue comes from mining, agriculture, entertainment, and those with historical Republican inclinations have lower levels of self-sufficiency as a proportion of its GDP than states whose primary revenues comes from technology and those with historical Democratic inclinations. \n",

    "- This hypothesis was created from the assumption that the United States is a consumer economy with decreasing emphasis on developing industries such as mining, agriculture, and so on. Republican states will lack the necessary funds from the state government to allocate resources for disaster relief and will require aid from the federal government, while Democratic states will be more able to fund their own resources for disaster relief.

One possible way it could be organized is by state order, most money spent to least, or vice versa.\n",
