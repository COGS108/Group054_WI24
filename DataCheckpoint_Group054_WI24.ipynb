The states are organized by alphabetical order and the year from 2022 down to 1977. As for data, majority of it are integers, which simplifies it a little. As for cleaning the dataset, we want to extract data from 2017 to 2022 only, which means we need to filter more than half the dataset.\n",

    "The second dataset by BEA, it is a dataset that provides the GDP by each state, seperated by region from most to least. This dataset includes each states GDP by quarter and takes inflation into account (2017 Dollar value). This dataset has many tables with valuable information, but we are focused on Tables 1, 3, and 5. Table 2 includes data about the Personal Income per state in the same format as Table 1. A few important varaibles in this dataset would include States, Regions, Quarters, and Total. These are the main variables that will help us analyze the data. Since the data is already well organized, the only things we would need to do is find missing data, if there is any, and understand why it may be missing. \n",

    "Our third dataset, Emergency Managment Performance Grants, is a detailed dataset of emergency funding each state as received. This dataset inlcudes every agency that has provided a specific state emergency funding. The data variables includes states, id, agency name, closing and opening date, and more. We are mainly looking for state, amount and reporting period (2017-2022), so we can focus on extracting those variables out. With the large amount of agency's in each state, it would be best to combine it all under the state, where we have the total number of funding per state. \n",

    "Our last dataset, Public Assistance Funded Projects Detail, is another very detailed dataset that has information about emergency funding. To be more exact, it has information about what kind of natural disasters, which county and it's county code, project amount, federal share obligated, total obligated, and more. For this project, knowing what specific natural disaster and how much a state got because of that isn't our main goal, so we would have to sort it by year, maintaining our goal of finding data from 2017-2022.\n",

    "\n",
    "With our datasets, it would be useful to look at them and understand if a state with a higher GDP gets more emergency funding overall. We want to see the relationships between the two and with the information we have, it would help prove our research question."
