    "The United States was born out of the colonies' desire to free from the tyranny of a government holding complete control over their commerce and rights. This wariness of a centralized governmental structure influences many aspects of how the government runs today, such as the separation of powers as labeled within the United States Constitution. The states can be considered, to an extent, nations within a nation. A study published in 2023 by smartasset<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) displays one aspect of this relationship - the depth to which states receive their funding from the federal government. But after decades of peace and prosperity as a singular united nation on the world stage - how many maintain this level of self-sufficiency in disasters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source we looked at was a data science project done by Money Geek that looked at which states were most reliant on federal aid. This project is relevant to ours because federal aid reduces the burden on a states budget and how much they can allocate towards disaster relief <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). To compute this, the team at Money Geek did not just look at total federal aid, but looked at federal funding as a percentage of state revenue and return on tax dollars which was a statistic showing how much the state got back for every dollar that they gave the government. What we learned from the metrics used (such as aid as a percentage of state revenue and return on tax dollars) is that often a data set will require a lot of cleaning and development of our own metrics before we can get the answer to our question. Our question being the relation between GDP and a state's amount spent on disaster relief. From the Money Geek project, we also saw how others incorporate graphs into their findings. Money geek did a very good job about making the main findings visible in the titles of their graphs and throughout their paragraphs. For example, one of the main findings from the data set was that states that get the most in federal aid are often republican states. Then, they created a illustrative bar chart to display this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, another project we found relevant from economy.com looking at how natural disasters affect national GDP, which we also found relevant to our project as it relates to natural disasters and uses GDP as a metric. However, our project takes a different angle by using GDP as a measure of a states self sufficiency and seeing how that correlates to how much disaster relief aid that state gets. Some relevant take-aways from the source were that natural disasters only have a minor impact on national GDP but can be very impactful for local GDP. For example, from economy.com calculations, real GDP growth for New Orleans fell 20% at an annual rate in the third quarter of 2005 after Katrina <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that in the United States in 2022, states with lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and historical Republican inclinations will be associated with an increase in federal disaster relief funding (as a percentage of the state's GDP). Conversely, states with higher GDP and historical Democratic ties will receive a lower percentage of their GDP in federal disaster relief funding. This study aims to analyze data over the past two decades to investigate these relationships, employing statistical analysis methods to understand the impact of economic status and political affiliation on disaster relief funding."

    "  - Number of variables: 22\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first dataset, GDP by state, is a dataset that gives us each states, GDP by year. The dataset includes data from 1977 - 2022, with the GDP of each state per year. The states are organized by alphabetical order and the year from 2022 down to 1977. As for data, majority of it are integers, which simplifies it a little. As for cleaning the dataset, we want to extract data from 2017 to 2022 only, which means we need to filter more than half the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset by BEA, it is a dataset that provides the GDP by each state, seperated by region from most to least. This dataset includes each states GDP by quarter and takes inflation into account (2017 Dollar value). This dataset has many tables with valuable information, but we are focused on Tables 1, 3, and 5. Table 2 includes data about the Personal Income per state in the same format as Table 1. A few important varaibles in this dataset would include States, Regions, Quarters, and Total. These are the main variables that will help us analyze the data. Since the data is already well organized, the only things we would need to do is find missing data, if there is any, and understand why it may be missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our third dataset, Emergency Managment Performance Grants, is a detailed dataset of emergency funding each state as received. This dataset inlcudes every agency that has provided a specific state emergency funding. The data variables includes states, id, agency name, closing and opening date, and more. We are mainly looking for state, amount and reporting period (2017-2022), so we can focus on extracting those variables out. With the large amount of agency's in each state, it would be best to combine it all under the state, where we have the total number of funding per state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our last dataset, Public Assistance Funded Projects Detail, is another very detailed dataset that has information about emergency funding. To be more exact, it has information about what kind of natural disasters, which county and it's county code, project amount, federal share obligated, total obligated, and more. For this project, knowing what specific natural disaster and how much a state got because of that isn't our main goal, so we would have to sort it by year, maintaining our goal of finding data from 2017-2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With our datasets, it would be useful to look at them and understand if a state with a higher GDP gets more emergency funding overall. We want to see the relationships between the two and with the information we have, it would help prove our research question."

    "Our data is sourced from governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations such as USA Facts, FEMA, and BEA.gov. These sources aim to provide a strictly non-partisan outlook on the actions of the federal government in an effort to promote a pillar of government so necessary to any government's foundation - transparency. These sources do not contain any private data, as any data determined to be accessible to the public by the Freedom of Information act forgoes data which would be deemed a breach of privacy. Our research does not aim to harm any particular population within a county or state, as it is focused on compiling and analyzing the financial aspect of the relationship between state and federal governments. Moreover, decisions on federal funding are guided by uniform, pre-established standards, and commitments, all found within the constitution of the United States. Our compilation of statistical information lacks sufficient means to overturn the nature of this centuries old relation. Electoral data analyzed is on a strictly state-level basis, meaning that we do not utilize a voter's personal information. "
